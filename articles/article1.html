    AWS Redshift has a special command called <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_UNLOAD.html"><b>UNLOAD</b></a> that allows
    you to export the result of a query to an S3 file. While you can download small query results directly
    from Query Editor v2, Redshift limits the number of rows that can be exported to 5 MB or 100,000 rows per the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/query-editor-v2-using.html">docs</a>.
    This is fine for most queries, but there are times when you need to move a large amount of data from Redshift
    to file (a DB migration, for instance), and it is generally faster to keep the data within the AWS ecosystem than it is to use an API. In such
    situations, <b>UNLOAD</b>
    is often the best solution.<br><br> <b>UNLOAD</b> has a simple syntax consisting of a query string and some
    additional format parameters, but formatting text
    literals is problematic because the SQL query must be enclosed in single quotes. To circumvent
    this issue, I used two other Redshift functions, <b>SUBSTRING</b> and <b>QUOTE_LITERAL</b>. <b>SUBSTRING</b> uses
    the following syntax:<br><br><b>(<em>character_string</em> FROM <em> start_position</em> [ FOR <em>
        number_characters </em>])</b><br><br>
    <b>QUOTE_LITERAL</b> returns a single quoted string from text. By combining these two functions, I was able to make
    'USD' the default currency for a "Currency" field in my query string within an UNLOAD function call.<br><br>
    <pre><code>CASE WHEN currency_field IS NULL THEN SUBSTRING(QUOTE_LITERAL(''USD''),2,3) ELSE currency_field END AS Currency</code></pre>
